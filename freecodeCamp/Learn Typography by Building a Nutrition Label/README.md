Typography is the art of styling your text to be easily readable and suit its purpose.
By building this page I learned how to style text, adjust line text, and position a text using CSS.

We'll look at some fundamental CSS font properties like **font-family**, **font-size**, **font-style**, and **font-weight**.

- **font-family** -> Change the typeface of your text. The font-family accepts a comma-separated list of strings, either referring to *specific8 or *generic* font-families. Specific font-family are quoted strings, such as "Helvetica" or "Times New Roman". Generic font-families are keywords such as *serif*, *sans-serif* and *monospace*. The browser will display the first available typeface form the provided list.

- **font-size** -> Control the size of your text elements. This property accepts lenght values, percentages, and a handful of keyword values.
