Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz

   You might wonder why this is important. After all, you can use a combination of CSS and JavaScript to make just about any HTML element behave in whatever way you want.

   Semantic HTML doesn't take any longer to write that non-semantic(bad) makeup if you do it consistently from the start of your project. Ever better, semantic makeup 
has other benefits beyound accessibility:   
  **1. Easier to develop with** -> you get some functionality for free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.  
  **2. Better on mobile** -> sematic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make resposive.   
  **3. Good for SEO.** -> search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings, links, ect. than keywords included in non-semantic <divs, ect., so your documents will be more findable by customers.
