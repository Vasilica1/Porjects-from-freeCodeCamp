Atributes that I used in this project:

- **aria-hidden** -> The aria-hidden attribute can be used to hide non-interactive content from the accesibility APIs. Adding **aria-hidden="true"** to an element removes that element and all of its children from the accesibility tree. The presence of the **aria-hidden** atribute hides content from assistive technology but does't visually hide anything.
